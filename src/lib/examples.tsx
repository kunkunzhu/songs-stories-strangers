  story:
    "if i could send a song back in time as a message to my younger self, i think this might be it. “i just want for you to love your life. i just want for you to not think twice - when somebody asks if you've been doing alright.” back then i worried so endlessly and felt everything so intensely. when i looked into the future sometimes it felt like i was staring into a blackhole. but still, everything eventually turns out alright.",
