            I have vivid memories and emotions attached to certain songs. And
            you might, as well. This is a little web app where you can share a
            story about a song that is meaningful to you and, in return, read
            about a song that holds significance for a complete stranger.{" "}

            At the end of the day, we are connected by stories. I cherish the
            moments when we recognize pieces of ourselves in someone elseâ€™s
            story, even that of a complete stranger, and realize how we are all
            more connected than we think.
