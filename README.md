# songs / stories / strangers

I have vivid memories and emotions attached to certain songs. And you might, as well. This is a little web app where you can share a story about a song that is meaningful to you and, in return, read about a song that holds significance for a complete stranger. At the end of the day, we are connected by stories. I cherish the moments when we recognize pieces of ourselves in someone elseâ€™s story, even that of a complete stranger, and realize how we are all more connected than we think. ð“ˆ’âŸ¡â‚Šâ‹†âˆ˜
