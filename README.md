# songs / stories / strangers

## about :

What song instantly takes you back to your childhood? What song reminds you of your best friend? What song did you have on-repeat the last time you fell in love?

I have vivid memories and emotions attached to certain songs. And my hunch is that you do, as well. Here, you could send out a song that hold meaning to you and, in return, receive a song that hold meaning for a complete stranger.

The reason that I created this app is because in an age where the music discovery experience is dominated by algorithmic recommendations, it feels serendipitous to discover new songs by learning about the songs that hold significance to someone else. And that, at the end of the day, we are connected by stories. I cherish the moments when we recognize pieces of ourselves in someone elseâ€™s story, even that of a complete stranger, and realize how we are all more connected than we think. ð“ˆ’âŸ¡â‚Šâ‹†âˆ˜
